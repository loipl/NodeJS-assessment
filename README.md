# Technical Skills Assessment (NodeJS + Express + MongoDB + Jquery)
Requirements

* Local development environment with NodeJS & MongoDB installed.

Instructions

1. Create a Github account if you don’t have one already
2. Send an email to jason at leadwrench dot com with the subject of “NodeJS Skills Assessment” and include your Github account ID in the body. You will have 1,5 hour to complete the assessment from the time you send this email.
3. Fork the repository at: https://github.com/loipl/NodeJS-assessment into your account
4. Pull your forked repository into your IDE
5. Install dependencies from "package.json"
5. Create new "data" folder to store MongoDB's data and create new database "nodejs-assessment"
6. From Mongo console, use "nodejs-assessment" database and add a new record into "userlist" collection with below content:
{'username' : 'test','email' : 'test@gmail.com','fullname' : 'Jason B.Hart','age' : 30,'location' : 'Silicon Valley','gender' : 'Male'}
7. Fix any errors to show above record in User List of homepage. 
Print the screen of homepage & save as "homepage.jpg" in public/images folder.
8. Implement missing code so that we can add new user from the UI. (Add new user UI is existing in homepage)
9. Implement missing code so that we can delete user from the UI. (Delete link is existing in homepage)
10. Push changes back to your forked repository (except changes in "data" & "node_modules" folder)
11. Create a Pull Request to integrate the fixed code back into the master repository. The Pull Request will ultimately not be merged but will signal your completion of the skills assessment.

Please ask for clarification if you have a question. Guessing an answer to an ambiguous directive will count against you.
